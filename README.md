Problem Statement:
This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification on the Iris dataset to classify flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The goal is to compare different SVM kernels (linear, rbf, poly, and sigmoid) and evaluate their performance in classifying the dataset accurately.
